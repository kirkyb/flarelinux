# Flare Linux Docker Images

The official Flare Linux repository.

## Project Setup

You must have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your computer.

To build the main Docker image, please run the main `build.sh` script.

```
git clone https://github.com/linuxforphp/flarelinux.git
cd flarelinux
./build
```

You will then be able to start testing the new image.

Have a lot of fun! :)
